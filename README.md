# Project Background
This project is based on data from a Third-Party Administrator (TPA) in the healthcare insurance industry. The company partners with multiple insurers and corporate clients to manage claims, provider networks, and member benefits.

Between 2023 and 2025, the TPA served over 200,000 beneficiaries and processed more than 150,000 claims annually. Core business metrics include membership growth, claims utilization rate, cost per member per month (PMPM), and claims turnaround time.

Key business metrics include:
- **Membership Growth Rate:** tracking the number of active beneficiaries year-over-year.
- **Claims Utilization Rate:** measuring the frequency and intensity of healthcare service use.
- **Cost per Member per Month (PMPM):** a benchmark for cost efficiency in healthcare financing.
- **Turnaround Time for Claims Processing:** a critical KPI for operational efficiency.
- **Healthcare Provider Network Expansion:** monitoring the growth of contracted hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies.

An interactive Power BI dashboard used to report and explore healthcare consumption trends can be found here [link].

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The database consists of four tables (~300K rows in total) that capture beneficiary information, policy relationships, and healthcare consumption data:
- **Beneficiaries:** contains demographic and enrollment details for each member, serving as the reference point for linking utilization records.
- **Consumption:** holds detailed records of healthcare service usage (inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, etc.), including service type, provider, and cost.
- **Policy Holder Records:** derived from the Beneficiaries table, this table groups members under their respective policy holders, enabling analysis at the policy or corporate level.
- **Beneficiary Records:** integrates beneficiary and consumption details, creating standardized records that allow one-to-many mapping between members and their service usage.

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
